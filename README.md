Find Playlists
==

When Albums are encoded a m3u playlist can be created, with Sonos systems these I find these unnecessary.

I prefer to reserve the Playlists section of the sonos player for playlists I have created. These scripts (bash) search for and remove m3u files.

Usage:

    ./bin/report_m3u /Path/to/Music  

To delete them switch to using the `remove_m3u` script.
